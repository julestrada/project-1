Our overall goal was to see factors associated with life expectancy in order to understand why some countries have higher life expectancies than others. To start out and get an overview of Life Expectancy, I first made a chloropleth of all countrtries.  To do this, I used folium, pandas, and matplotlib.  When I created this map, I noticed that that overall eastern countries have lower life expectancy than western countries. To be able to prove this easily in a presentation format, I created a bar graph that has eastern and western countries side by side.  This method showed the drastic comparison between western and eastern countries in age.  Overall, I beleive that a chloropleth was the most effective method when trying to compare over 100 countries with differing data.  It provided my team an overall snapshot of what we needed to visualize to get an in depth look of life expectancy amongst the world.
